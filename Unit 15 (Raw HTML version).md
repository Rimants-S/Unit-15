## Website Evaluation
There are many things that go into making a website, and depending on what the intended audience of the website is, will change how relevant and important each part of the website is. For example a website designed for young children to learn will mainly involve lots of colours, pictures, videos and such features and the general layout of the website would be made as easy to navigate and understand as possible. All of which would make the website more appealing to young children while also making sure that they can use it. This would be in contrast to how a website targeted at more senior people would be made. While an easy to grasp and use layout would still be the standard, it would also be less brightly coloured and have lots more text.
The two websites that I will be looking at are Nike and Amazon. Nike's intended audience is mainly teenagers, young adults and sports players. Contrastingly, the intended audience for Amazon is more broad due to the nature of the site and their intended audience is simply anyone looking to buy something reasonable online. This means that, while the two companies are both e-commerce, they approach designing a website quite differently. 

### Amazon
To start, the general layout of Amazon's website makes it easy to navigate due to navbar at the top along with a search bar and how the content is put into a grid pattern, allowing anyone new to the website to be able find any sort of product that the company offers. This instantly gives users comfort when using the website, making them more likely to keep using the website and also return to it, which is especially good for any user that might not be very computer literate.
Amazon also makes sure that all the content on their website is as easy to understand as possible by making it clear what is on sale, what purchases are good deals, what they recommend each user and other small things that make the site more user-friendly. This also ties in with their audience, since the easier the site is to navigate and understand the more people can potentially use the site.

Amazon has also been able to keep repeat customers interested and using their website by making it so that whenever customers browse objects that they are interested in, Amazon's algorithms will then show each customers similar products. This makes customers want to keep browsing to try and find better deals, and other things that they may be interested in. However, this is when either the user has already browsed products or has signed in and previous searches have been applied to the algorithm, meaning that new users won't have specialised recommendations for them. Amazon deals with this by having the generally popular or trending products from all age ranges and product types on their homepage, enticing even new users.

### Nike
To begin with, Nike has a more specific audience mainly involving teenagers, young adults and sports players. To appeal to this audience Nike has made their website minimalistic. They do this by keeping their colour scheme of mainly white and only showing their newest and most popular products. This is most likely done by Nike to show potential customers the best and newest things that the company can offer. It also means that teenagers and young adults, who generally have a shorter attention span, will be more likely to stay and use the website. The general layout of Nike's website is also a grid pattern, but they try to break up each row a bit more, while still keeping the website somewhat symmetrical.

Another thing that Nike does to keep users interested is by adding terms like "don't miss" on limited items, making them seem even more rare. This has the effect, especially on younger generations, of making people want the item more, since it is now seen as rarer and more valuable. There is also a secondary effect of this, which is that people don't want to be left out when products like this go on sale, driving demand for them higher. Nike has been able to capitalise on these effects with their website and other promotions.

### Evaluation
Overall, while both companies' websites are made for e-commerce, they approach designing their website differently due to their target audiences. This has made the layout and general look of the websites reasonably different. They both have somewhat different colour schemes and typography. Amazon has a wider variety in their colour scheme, with an easily readable typography, since they need to appeal to as many people as possible, while Nike has a more defined colour scheme which they stick to throughout their website creating more consistency and their typography also follows a similar principle. Both achieve their requirements, but this also creates an image of the brand to most people, whether good or bad. Another minor difference between them, is their level of consistency between pages. While Amazon keeps consistency in its general design like the navbar, footer, and some other small parts, there are also parts that change quite a bit between pages. On the other hand, Nike is able to keep the consistency between their pages better by keeping the same colour scheme throughout, same navbar, footer and most other parts, which gives users a better image when looking through the website.

A lot of differences can be found between the two websites, but there are also a number of similarities. One of them is their simplicity and layout. This works in both of their favours, since simplicity makes the website more appealing and can make it easier to navigate, however Nike overshadows Amazon here, due to the nature of Amazon trying to appeal to a wider variety, they have to include extra things that make the website slightly more cluttered than Nike. Another positive website principle they both follow is easy loading and navigation on their websites. They have both taken extra care to optimise their images, code, etc to make sure that the website loads as fast as possible, since the slower it loads, the more likely people are to use another more optimised website. This can also have meant reducing clutter on the page and making it easier to navigate by including a clear navigation bar and making each page clear as to what it does and what information it holds. The last part that is quite similar between them is their level of communication for the users. Nike and Amazon have both done very well when it comes to conveying information to their users, whether that be new deals or brand new items, they both showcase these things on their main page and navbar, making them stand out and persuade people to look at them.

#### Publicity Page
The film that I chose to do the page on was Uncharted. This is because it is a film I saw recently and enjoyed.

If the html within GitHub don't work or some other reason, then this also holds my website work.
